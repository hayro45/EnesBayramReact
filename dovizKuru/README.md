## HTTP Requests with Axios

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It offers a simple API for sending asynchronous requests to REST endpoints, handling responses, and performing CRUD operations. With built-in support for interceptors, automatic JSON transformations, and comprehensive error handling, Axios streamlines data fetching and state management in React applications.
